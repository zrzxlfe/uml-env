</h2>
<p>When booting up the kernel, fsck failed, and dropped me into a shell to fix
things up. I ran fsck -y, which hung:</p>
<p>

<p>The standard drill in this sort of situation is to fire up gdb on the
signal thread, which, in this case, was pid 1935. In another window, I
run gdb and attach pid 1935.</p>

<p>Let's see what's currently running:</p>
<p>
<blockquote><code>
<pre>(gdb) p current_task.pid
$1 = 0
</pre>
</code></blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>It's the idle thread, which means that fsck went to sleep for some
reason and never woke up.</p>
<p>Let's guess that the last process in the process list is fsck:</p>
<p>
<blockquote><code>
<pre>(gdb) p current_task.prev_task.comm
$13 = "fsck.ext2\000\000\000\000\000\000"
</pre>
</code></blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>It is, so let's see what it thinks it's up to:</p>
<p>
<blockquote><code>
<pre>(gdb) p current_task.prev_task.thread
$14 = {extern_pid = 1980, tracing = 0, want_tracing = 0, forking = 0, 
  kernel_stack_page = 0, signal_stack = 1342627840, syscall = {id = 4, args = {
      3, 134973440, 1024, 0, 1024}, have_result = 0, result = 50590720}, 
  request = {op = 2, u = {exec = {ip = 1350467584, sp = 2952789424}, fork = {
        regs = {1350467584, 2952789424, 0 &lt;repeats 15 times&gt;}, sigstack = 0, 
        pid = 0}, switch_to = 0x507e8000, thread = {proc = 0x507e8000, 
        arg = 0xaffffdb0, flags = 0, new_pid = 0}, input_request = {
        op = 1350467584, fd = -1342177872, proc = 0, pid = 0}}}}
</pre>

<p></p>
<p>The interesting things here are the fact that its .thread.syscall.id
is __NR_write (see the big switch in arch/um/kernel/syscall_kern.c or the
defines in include/asm-um/arch/unistd.h), and that it never returned.
Also, its .request.op is OP_SWITCH (see arch/um/include/user_util.h).
These mean that it went into a write, and, for some reason, called
schedule().</p>
<p>The fact that it never returned from write means that its stack
should be fairly interesting. Its pid is 1980 (.thread.extern_pid).
That process is being ptraced by the signal thread, so it must be
detached before gdb can attach it:
<blockquote><code>
<pre>(gdb) call detach(1980)

Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.
&lt;function called from gdb&gt;
The program being debugged stopped while in a function called from GDB.
When the function (detach) is done executing, GDB will silently
stop (instead of continuing to evaluate the expression containing
the function call).
(gdb) call detach(1980)
$15 = 0
</pre>
</code></blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>The first detach segfaults for some reason, and the second one
succeeds.</p>
<p>Now I detach from the signal thread, attach to the fsck thread, and
look at its stack:

<p></p>
<p>The interesting things here are :
<ul>
<li>There are two segfaults on this stack (frames 9 and 14)</li>
<li>The first faulting address (frame 11) is 0x50000800
<blockquote><code>
<pre>(gdb) p (void *)1342179328
$16 = (void *) 0x50000800
</pre>
</code></blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>The initial faulting address is interesting because it is on the idle
thread's stack. I had been seeing the idle thread segfault for no
apparent reason, and the cause looked like stack corruption. In hopes
of catching the culprit in the act, I had turned off all protections
to that stack while the idle thread wasn't running. This apparently
tripped that trap.</p>
<p>However, the more immediate problem is that second segfault and I'm
going to concentrate on that. First, I want to see where the fault
happened, so I have to go look at the sigcontent struct in frame 8: </p>

<p></p>
<p>That's not very useful, so I'll try a more manual method:
<blockquote><code>
<pre>(gdb) p *((struct sigcontext *) (&amp;sig + 1))
$19 = {gs = 0, __gsh = 0, fs = 0, __fsh = 0, es = 43, __esh = 0, ds = 43, 
  __dsh = 0, edi = 1342179328, esi = 1350378548, ebp = 1342630440, 
  esp = 1342630420, ebx = 1348150624, edx = 1280, ecx = 0, eax = 0, 
  trapno = 14, err = 4, eip = 268480945, cs = 35, __csh = 0, eflags = 66118, 
  esp_at_signal = 1342630420, ss = 43, __ssh = 0, fpstate = 0x0, oldmask = 0, 
  cr2 = 1280}
</pre>
</code></blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>The ip is in handle_mm_fault:
<blockquote><code>
<pre>(gdb) p (void *)268480945
$20 = (void *) 0x1000b1b1
(gdb) i sym $20

</code></blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>Specifically, it's in pte_alloc:
<blockquote><code>

<p></p>
<p>To find where in handle_mm_fault this is, I'll jump forward in the
code until I see an address in that procedure:</p>
<p>

<p></p>
<p>Something is apparently wrong with the page tables or vma_structs,
so lets go back to frame 11 and have a look at them:
<blockquote><code>
<pre>#11 0x1006c0aa in segv (address=1342179328, is_write=2) at trap_kern.c:50
50        handle_mm_fault(current, vma, address, is_write);
(gdb) call pgd_offset_proc(vma-&gt;vm_mm, address)
$22 = (pgd_t *) 0x80a548c
</pre>
</code></blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>That's pretty bogus. Page tables aren't supposed to be in process
text or data areas. Let's see what's in the vma:
<blockquote><code>
<pre>(gdb) p *vma

</pre>
</code></blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>This also pretty bogus. With all of the 0x80xxxxx and 0xaffffxxx
addresses, this is looking like a stack was plonked down on top of
these structures. Maybe it's a stack overflow from the next page:</p>
<p>
<blockquote><code>
<pre>(gdb) p vma
$25 = (struct vm_area_struct *) 0x507d2434
</pre>

<p></p>
<p>That's towards the lower quarter of the page, so that would have to
have been pretty heavy stack overflow:</p>

<p>It's not stack overflow. The only "stack-like" piece of this data
is the vma_struct itself.</p>
<p>At this point, I don't see any avenues to pursue, so I just have to
admit that I have no idea what's going on. What I will do, though, is
stick a trap on the segfault handler which will stop if it sees any
writes to the idle thread's stack. That was the thing that happened
first, and it may be that if I can catch it immediately, what's going
on will be somewhat clearer.</p>

<p>After setting a trap in the SEGV handler for accesses to the signal

<p>fsck hung again, this time by hitting the trap:</p>

<p>I need to get the signal thread to detach from pid 4127 so that I can
attach to it with gdb. This is done by sending it a SIGUSR1, which is
caught by the signal thread, which detaches the process:
<blockquote><code>
<pre>kill -USR1 4127

<p></p>
<p>Now I can run gdb on it:

<p>Looking at the source shows that the fault happened during a
call to copy_to_user to copy the data into the kernel:
<blockquote><code>
<pre>107             count -= chars;
108             copy_from_user(p,buf,chars);
109             p += chars;
110             buf += chars;
</pre>
</code></blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>p is the pointer which must contain 0x50000800, since buf contains
0x80b8800 (frame 8 above). It is defined as:
<blockquote><code>
<pre>                p = offset + bh-&gt;b_data;
</pre>
</code></blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>I need to figure out what bh is, and it just so happens that bh is
passed as an argument to mark_buffer_uptodate and mark_buffer_dirty a
few lines later, so I do a little disassembly:</p>
<p>
<blockquote><code>

<p></p>
<p>At that point, bh is in %edx (address 0x1001c2da), which is
calculated at 0x1001c2c2 as %ebp + 0xfffffdd4, so I figure exactly
what that is, taking %ebp from the sigcontext_struct above:
<blockquote><code>
<pre>(gdb) p (void *)1342631484
$5 = (void *) 0x5006ee3c
(gdb) p 0x5006ee3c+0xfffffdd4
$6 = 1342630928
(gdb) p (void *)$6
$7 = (void *) 0x5006ec10
(gdb) p *((void **)$7)
$8 = (void *) 0x50100200
</pre>
</code></blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>Now, I look at the structure to see what's in it, and particularly,
what its b_data field contains:
<blockquote><code>
<pre>(gdb) p *((struct buffer_head *)0x50100200)
$13 = {b_next = 0x50289380, b_blocknr = 49405, b_size = 1024, b_list = 0, 
  b_dev = 15872, b_count = {counter = 1}, b_rdev = 15872, b_state = 24, 
  b_flushtime = 0, b_next_free = 0x501001a0, b_prev_free = 0x50100260, 
  b_this_page = 0x501001a0, b_reqnext = 0x0, b_pprev = 0x507fcf58, 
  b_data = 0x50000800 "", b_page = 0x50004000, 
  b_end_io = 0x10017f60 &lt;end_buffer_io_sync&gt;, b_dev_id = 0x0, 
  b_rsector = 98810, b_wait = {lock = &lt;optimized out or zero length&gt;, 
    task_list = {next = 0x50100248, prev = 0x50100248}, __magic = 1343226448, 
    __creator = 0}, b_kiobuf = 0x0}
</pre>
</code></blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>The b_data field is indeed 0x50000800, so the question becomes how
that happened. The rest of the structure looks fine, so this probably is
not a case of data corruption. It happened on purpose somehow.</p>
<p>The b_page field is a pointer to the page_struct representing the
0x50000000 page. Looking at it shows the kernel's idea of the state
of that page:</p>
<p>
<blockquote><code>
<pre>(gdb) p *$13.b_page
$17 = {list = {next = 0x50004a5c, prev = 0x100c5174}, mapping = 0x0, 
  index = 0, next_hash = 0x0, count = {counter = 1}, flags = 132, lru = {
    next = 0x50008460, prev = 0x50019350}, wait = {
    lock = &lt;optimized out or zero length&gt;, task_list = {next = 0x50004024, 
      prev = 0x50004024}, __magic = 1342193708, __creator = 0}, 
  pprev_hash = 0x0, buffers = 0x501002c0, virtual = 1342177280, 
  zone = 0x100c5160}
</pre>
</code></blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>Some sanity-checking: the virtual field shows the "virtual" address
of this page, which in this kernel is the same as its "physical"
address, and the page_struct itself should be mem_map[0], since it
represents the first page of memory:</p>
<p>
<blockquote><code>
<pre>(gdb) p (void *)1342177280
$18 = (void *) 0x50000000
(gdb) p mem_map
$19 = (mem_map_t *) 0x50004000
</pre>
</code></blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>These check out fine.</p>
<p>Now to check out the page_struct itself. In particular, the flags
field shows whether the page is considered free or not:
<blockquote><code>
<pre>(gdb) p (void *)132
$21 = (void *) 0x84
</pre>
</code></blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>The "reserved" bit is the high bit, which is definitely not set, so
the kernel considers the signal stack page to be free and available to
be used.</p>
<p>At this point, I jump to conclusions and start looking at my early
boot code, because that's where that page is supposed to be reserved.</p>
<p>In my setup_arch procedure, I have the following code which looks
just fine:</p>
<p>
<blockquote><code>
<pre>bootmap_size = init_bootmem(start_pfn, end_pfn - start_pfn);
free_bootmem(__pa(low_physmem) + bootmap_size, high_physmem - low_physmem);
</pre>
</code></blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>Two stack pages have already been allocated, and low_physmem points
to the third page, which is the beginning of free memory.</p>
<p>The init_bootmem call declares the entire memory to the boot memory
manager, which marks it all reserved. The free_bootmem call frees up
all of it, except for the first two pages. This looks correct to me.</p>
<p>So, I decide to see init_bootmem run and make sure that it is
marking those first two pages as reserved. I never get that far.</p>
<p>Stepping into init_bootmem, and looking at bootmem_map before
looking at what it contains shows the following:</p>
<p>
<blockquote><code>
<pre>(gdb) p bootmem_map
$3 = (void *) 0x50000000
</pre>
</code></blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>Aha! The light dawns. That first page is doing double duty as a
stack and as the boot memory map. The last thing that the boot memory
manager does is to free the pages used by its memory map, so this page is
getting freed even its marked as reserved.</p>
<p>The fix was to initialize the boot memory manager before allocating
those two stack pages, and then allocate them through the boot memory
manager. After doing this, and fixing a couple of subsequent buglets,
the stack corruption problem disappeared.</p>
